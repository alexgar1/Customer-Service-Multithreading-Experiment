Necessary Files

Ensure the following files are in your project directory before proceeding:

    acsnew.c - Main source file for the simulation.
    linkedls.c - Linked list operations required by the main source.
    linkedls.h - Linked list header.
    Makefile - Contains rules for building and cleaning the project.
    customers.txt - Example input file with customer data (ensure the format matches the expectations of the program).

Instructions on Make

To compile the project, navigate to the directory containing the files and execute:
make

This will use the Makefile to compile the source files into an executable named acs.
Once the program is compiled, you can run it using:

./acs customers.txt

Replace customers.txt with your specific input file if you have another file prepared. Ensure the input file format is correct as expected by the program.
